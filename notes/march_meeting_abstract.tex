The parameter derivative of the \textit{ab initio} energy functional is a key ingredient in quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) wave function optimization methods.
A naive Monte Carlo estimate of this derivative, however, suffers from an infinite variance which inhibits the efficiency of optimization methods which rely on a stable estimate of the derivative.
In this work we derive a simple polynomial regularization of the naive estimator which alleviates the problem of infinite variance at the cost of a cubic scaling bias.
Being agnostic to wave function parameterization and applying equally to variational and diffusion Monte Carlo methods, the regularized estimator stands as a light weight approach to the infinite variance problem of the parameter derivative in QMC.
