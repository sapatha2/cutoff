\section{Introduction}
%Nice first sentence: Low-variance MC estimates of the expectation value of the Hamiltonian and its parameter derivatives play an integral role in the efficiency of QMC wavefunction optimization techniques.
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Overall goal } The development of efficient optimization schemes for correlated trial wave functions has been a long standing problem in quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations of realistic systems.

\item \textbf{Barrier to achieving that goal } A significant drain on the efficiency of these schemes is the infinite variance of a naive estimator for the parameter derivative of the expectation value of the energy.

\item \textbf{Current state of the art} The most widely accepted solutions to this infinite variance problem include Sorella's reweighting scheme [ref] and the improved estimators proposed by Assaraf and Caffarel [ref].

\item \textbf{Our advancement to the state of the art } In this work, we derive a simple regularization of the naive estimator which handles the infinite variance problem without relying on auxiliary or guiding wave functions.
\end{enumerate}
