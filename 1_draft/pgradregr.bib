abstract = {Python-based simulations of chemistry framework (PySCF) is a general-purpose electronic structure platform designed from the ground up to emphasize code simplicity, so as to facilitate new method development and enable flexible computational workflows. The package provides a wide range of tools to support simulations of finite-size systems, extended systems with periodic boundary conditions, low-dimensional periodic systems, and custom Hamiltonians, using mean-field and post-mean-field methods with standard Gaussian basis functions. To ensure ease of extensibility, PySCF uses the Python language to implement almost all of its features, while computationally critical paths are implemented with heavily optimized C routines. Using this combined Python/C implementation, the package is as efficient as the best existing C or Fortran-based quantum chemistry programs. In this paper, we document the capabilities and design philosophy of the current version of the PySCF package.

Assuming no prior knowledge on the subject, we review in depth the Metropolisâ€“Hastings algorithm used in VMC for sampling the square of an approximate wave function, discussing details important for applications to electronic systems. We also review in detail the more sophisticated DMC algorithm within the fixed-node approximation, introduced to avoid the infamous Fermionic sign problem, which allows one to sample a more accurate approximation to the ground-state wave function. Throughout this review, we discuss the statistical methods used for evaluating expectation values and statistical uncertainties. In particular, we show how to estimate nonlinear functions of expectation values and their statistical uncertainties."
